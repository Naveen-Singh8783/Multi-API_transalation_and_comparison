# Translation Comparison Tool

This project is a web-based tool designed to compare translations from multiple APIs, including **Google Translate**, **MyMemory**, and **OpenAI's GPT models**. It allows users to translate text, compare results, and analyze the quality of translations through either OpenAI's GPT or a custom fallback evaluation function.

## Features

### üåê Multi-API Translation:
- **Google Translate API** for high-speed translations.
- **MyMemory API** for community-based translation support.
- **OpenAI GPT Integration** for detailed analysis and ranking of translations.

### üõ† Custom Evaluation:
- A **fallback evaluation function** that:
  - Analyzes semantic similarity.
  - Compares text length differences.
  - Evaluates punctuation correctness.
  - Determines the better translation based on metrics.

### üñ• User-Friendly Interface:
- Simple input fields for source text, source language, and target language selection.
- API key management for OpenAI's GPT integration.
- Responsive design with real-time API responses.
